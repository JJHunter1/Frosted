# Frosted
This is my fork just to make a few elements more aesthetic.


## Spicetify Theme

This theme is meant to be a transparent theme for use with backgrounds and blurred effects.

#### *Important:*

This theme would have had to overwrite a lot of the colors set by spicetify, so instead I opted to make the theme with the replace_colors config off. If you install this and your spotify is completely black then you didn't read the installation instructions all the way.

### Installation

To install the current version:

* Clone/Download this repo
* Copy the Frosted folder into your spicetify themes folder
* Run `spicetify config replace_colors 0 current_theme Frosted`
* Profit

### Updating

To update:

* Open a terminal in the folder location and then just `git pull`
* If for some reason this fails, just re-install

### Changing background
Change the variable values in the user.css file with the urls as values, then change the `--bg` variable to whatever variable you want your wallpaper to be.
